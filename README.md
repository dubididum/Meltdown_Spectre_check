# Meltdown_Spectre_check
A little ps1 script to check if the patches are installed

This Powershell is for a status check of CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre) & CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown) on your Windows System.
You can simply change the output to a nagios plugin or something like that.

The both module files have to be in the same directory as the ps1 script.
I have purchased the modules from microsoft.
